# A Guide to Firebase Web Push Notifications

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a foundational guide for implementing web push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) in a web application. The goal is to understand the core concepts, setup process, and testing methodology. The examples are based on a React Proof of Concept (PoC).

## 2. Key Knowledge

### 2.1. How to Create and Organize a Firebase Project

A Firebase project is the top-level container for your applications. It's good practice to have separate projects for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) to keep data and configurations isolated.

**Steps:**

1.  **Navigate to the Firebase Console**: Go to [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  **Add a New Project**: Click on "Add project".
3.  **Name Your Project**: Provide a descriptive name. For our PoC, we used `poc-web-push-noti-dev`.
4.  **Google Analytics**: It's recommended to enable Google Analytics. It provides valuable insights into notification engagement, such as how many notifications were received and opened.
5.  **Create Project**: Click "Create project" and wait for it to be provisioned.

### 2.2. How to Add a Web App to Your Firebase Project

Once your project is created, you need to register your web application with it.

**Steps:**

1.  **Register App**: In your project's dashboard, click the web icon (`</>`) to start the setup workflow.
2.  **Add App Nickname**: Give your app a nickname (e.g., "PoC Web App").
3.  **Get Configuration**: Firebase will generate a `firebaseConfig` object. This object contains all the keys your application needs to connect to Firebase services.

    ```javascript
    // Your web app's Firebase configuration
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "AIza...",
      authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "your-project-id",
      storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "1234567890",
      appId: "1:1234567890:web:abcdef123456",
      measurementId: "G-ABCDEFGHIJ" // Optional, for Google Analytics
    };
    ```

4.  **Integrate into Your Code**: In our React PoC, this configuration is used in `src/firebase.js` to initialize the connection.

    ```javascript
    // src/firebase.js
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

    const firebaseConfig = { /* ... your config ... */ };

    // Initialize Firebase
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    ```

    > **Security Hint**: It is a best practice to store these keys in environment variables (`.env` files) rather than hardcoding them directly in the source code. This prevents sensitive keys from being committed to version control.

5.  **Generate VAPID Key**: For web push notifications to work, you need a VAPID key (Web Push certificate). This key authenticates your application server to the push service.
    *   Go to **Project Settings** (click the gear icon ⚙️).
    *   Select the **Cloud Messaging** tab.
    *   Under the **Web configuration** section, find **Web Push certificates**.
    *   Click **Generate key pair**. This key will be used later when requesting a user's notification token.

### 2.3. How Push Notifications Work (Foreground vs. Background)

Web push notifications are handled differently depending on whether the user has your web app open and active (foreground) or if the tab is in the background/closed (background).

#### Key Components:

*   **Main Application (`App.js`)**: The visible part of your website. It's responsible for requesting permission and handling notifications when the app is in the **foreground**.
*   **Service Worker (`firebase-messaging-sw.js`)**: A script that runs in the background, separate from your web page. It is essential for receiving and displaying notifications when your app is in the **background** or closed.

#### Visualizable Flow

Here is a simplified flow of how notifications are handled:

```
                                 +------------------+
                                 |   FCM Servers    |
                                 +------------------+
                                          |
                               (Sends Push Message)
                                          |
                                          v
                               +--------------------+
                               | Browser Push Service |
                               | (e.g., Chrome, FF) |
                               +--------------------+
                                          |
                                          |
           +-------------------------------------------------------------+
           |                        User's Browser                       |
           +-------------------------------------------------------------+
                                          |
                                          |
      +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
      | Is the web app tab active (foreground)?                                 |
      +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                   |                                       |
                  YES                                      NO
                   |                                       |
                   v                                       v
   +-------------------------------+      +------------------------------------+
   |        Main Application       |      |          Service Worker            |
   |        (src/App.js)           |      |  (public/firebase-messaging-sw.js) |
   +-------------------------------+      +------------------------------------+
                   |                                       |
   (onMessageListener is triggered)         (onBackgroundMessage is triggered)
                   |                                       |
                   v                                       v
+---------------------------------++    ++-------------------------------------++
|   Display notification inside   |    |      Display a system notification    |
|   the app (e.g., a toast/alert) |    | (pops up from the OS/browser)         |
+---------------------------------++    ++-------------------------------------++

```

*   **Foreground**: The `onMessageListener` in `src/firebase.js` catches the incoming message, allowing you to display it directly within your React component.
*   **Background**: The `onBackgroundMessage` handler in `public/firebase-messaging-sw.js` catches the message and uses the browser's native `showNotification` API to display it to the user.

### 2.4. How to Conduct a Simple Web Push Test

The Firebase Console provides a simple way to send test messages to a specific device or browser.

**Steps:**

1.  **Get the FCM Registration Token**:
    *   Run your web application.
    *   Click the **"Enable Notifications"** button and grant permission when prompted by the browser.
    *   The application will log and display a long string of characters. This is the **FCM Token**. Copy it. This token uniquely identifies your browser.

    

2.  **Navigate to Firebase Messaging**:
    *   In the Firebase Console, go to the **Engage** section in the left-hand menu and click on **Messaging**.

3.  **Create a New Campaign**:
    *   Click **"New campaign"** and select **"Notifications"**.

4.  **Compose the Notification**:
    *   Enter a **Notification title** (e.g., "Hello from Firebase") and **Notification text** (e.g., "This is a test!").

5.  **Send a Test Message**:
    *   On the right-hand side, click the **"Send test message"** button.
    *   Paste the FCM Token you copied in Step 1 into the field labeled "Add an FCM registration token".
    *   Click the **`+`** icon to add it to the list.
    *   Click **"Test"**.

    

**Expected Results:**

*   **If your app is in the foreground**: You will see the notification title and body appear directly on the web page, as handled by your React component.
*   **If your app is in the background (or closed)**: You will receive a system notification from your browser/OS.
